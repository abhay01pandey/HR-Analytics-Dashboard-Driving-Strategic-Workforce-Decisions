# HR-Analytics-Dashboard-Driving-Strategic-Workforce-Decisions
This project presents a dynamic HR Analytics Dashboard designed to provide a comprehensive and visual overview of an organization's workforce data. By transforming raw HR data into actionable insights, this dashboard empowers human resources and leadership teams to make data-driven decisions, improve employee retention, and optimize talent management strategies.
# Project Overview
 The organization was experiencing high employee attrition without a clear understanding of its root causes, making it difficult to implement effective retention strategies.
 My objective was to create a centralized, easy-to-interpret dashboard that highlights key trends and patterns in employee data.
 I developed this interactive dashboard using Power BI, integrating various datasets to analyze attrition by demographics, job role, salary, and more.
 The dashboard successfully identified key drivers of attrition, enabling stakeholders to develop targeted interventions and improve overall workforce stability.
# Key Features
 * Comprehensive Metrics: Displays critical KPIs such as Overall Employees, Attrition Rate, Average Age, and Average Salary.
 * Interactive Visualizations: Features intuitive charts and graphs for a deeper dive into attrition by education, age, salary slab, and job role.
 * Attrition Analysis: Provides detailed breakdowns of attrition based on gender, age, and years at the company.
 * Role-Based Insights: Highlights which job roles are most affected by attrition, allowing for targeted talent management efforts.
# Insights
 * High Attrition Rate: The dashboard reveals a notable attrition rate of 16.1%, indicating a need for strategic intervention.
 * Life Sciences Disproportionately Affected: Employees with a Life Sciences background show the highest attrition, accounting for 38% of all departures.
 * Laboratory Technicians at Risk: The role of Laboratory Technician has the highest number of attritions at 62, suggesting potential issues within this specific department.
 * Experience vs. Attrition: The data shows a significant spike in attrition for employees with 1-2 years and 5-6 years of tenure, highlighting critical retention windows.
 * Younger Workforce Attrition: The 26-35 age group shows the highest attrition, indicating that efforts should be focused on retaining younger talent.
# Tools/Technologies Used
 * Data Visualization/BI Tool: Microsoft Power BI
 * Data Source: Excel
# Real-World Application
This dashboard is a vital tool for HR departments, offering a clear and immediate understanding of employee turnover. It can be used to:
 * Inform Recruitment Strategies: Target and retain talent in high-attrition roles.
 * Optimize Employee Engagement: Identify at-risk groups and develop tailored retention programs.
 * Support Strategic Planning: Provide leadership with the data needed to forecast workforce needs and budgets.
