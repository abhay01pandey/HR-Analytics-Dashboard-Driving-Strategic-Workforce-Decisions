# HR-Analytics-Dashboard-Driving-Strategic-Workforce-Decisions
This project features a Human Resources (HR) Analytics Dashboard built in Power BI, designed to analyze and visualize employee attrition within the organization. The primary goal is to provide HR leadership and department heads with a clear, data-driven view of attrition trends, key demographic drivers, and high-risk job roles to support targeted retention strategies.

Key Metrics Tracked:

Overall Employees: 1,470

Total Attrition: 237

Attrition Rate: 16.1%

Average Age: 37

Average Salary: $7K

Average Years at Company: 7.0

# Dataset & Tools Used
Dataset:

The analysis is based on a structured dataset containing employee demographic, tenure, salary, and job role information, along with their final attrition status.

Tools:

Power BI: Utilized for data modeling, calculated metrics (DAX), and the creation of all interactive visuals, KPIs, and filtering capabilities.

Power Query: Used for initial data cleaning, transformation, and ensuring data quality before loading into the data model.

# Workflow
The dashboard creation followed a structured business intelligence process:

Data Import & Modeling: Raw data was imported into Power BI, and relationships between tables were established to ensure the data model was efficient.

Data Transformation (Power Query): Data cleaning steps were performed, including handling null values, standardizing text columns, and ensuring date columns were in the correct format.

Metric Calculation (DAX): Key performance indicators (KPIs) such as Attrition Rate and Average Salary/Age were calculated using Data Analysis Expressions (DAX).

Visual Development: A series of dynamic charts (bar charts, line charts, donut charts, and tables) were built to analyze attrition across multiple dimensions (Age, Role, Salary, Education).

Interactivity & Filtering: Department slicers/filters (Human Resources, Research & Development, Sales) were implemented to allow users to drill down into specific business units.

# Dashboard Insights
The dashboard delivers immediate insights on where attrition is concentrated:

Demographic Drivers: Attrition is almost equally split by gender (Male: 140, Female: 97).

Age and Tenure Risk: The largest volume of attrition (116) occurs in the 26-35 age bracket. The area chart showing Attrition By Year At Company peaks sharply in the first year, indicating a high risk during the initial tenure (onboarding/probation).

Job Role Hotspots: The highest number of attritions is concentrated in Laboratory Technician (62), Sales Executive (57), and Research Scientist (47) roles.

Salary and Education: The majority of individuals who attrited fell into the "Upto 5K" salary slab (163) and held a background in Life Sciences (38% of total attrition by education).

# Results and Conclusion

The HR Analytics Dashboard provides a strong foundation for developing targeted retention programs.

The analysis clearly indicates that attrition is an early tenure issue, heavily concentrated among junior salary brackets and specific high-volume roles (Laboratory Tech, Sales Exec). This suggests opportunities to improve compensation structures for lower salary bands and enhance the onboarding and mentorship experience during the critical first year of employment.
